# Mini Project
## Crowd Resource Allocation
### This project is a crowd-sourced resource allocation tool where users submit requests for limited resources. Community members vote on these requests, and the system ranks them based on the number of votes received. The ranking logic is transparent and explainable, ensuring fairness. The application is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy with SQLite as the database.
